What is this stupid app doing?
_Foo has_many Bar_ - acts_as_paranoid test models
_Xx has_many Yy_ - acts_as_archival test models

h1. Reasons to hate acts_as_paranoid
# It has an inconsistent interface
  See tests in "foo_test.rb":http://github.com/janxious/indyrb_archival_demo/blob/master/test/unit/foo_test.rb
# It is not atomic.

# "Warner Hertzog":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI
# The code is really complicated
"aap - paranoid_find_wrapper.rb":http://github.com/technoweenie/acts_as_paranoid/blob/master/lib/caboose/acts/paranoid_find_wrapper.rb
# Using the code is really complicated
See my examples above
# It significantly messes with find, destroy, and delete.
This will screw you, immediately, or when it's really important.
Additionally, everyone needs on your team needs to know how and why it's screwing with these methods, or they will screw everyone.
# It is annoying - it lacks lots of helpers you would expect
    <pre><code>
    f = Foo.first
    f.destroy
    f.recover! # ERRRORRRRROR, Wesley; you can't modify 'f' because it's now a locked hash.
    Foo.find_with_deleted(:all).first.recover!
    Foo.all_with_deleted doesn't exist #ERROR NoMethod
    Foo.first_with_deleted doesn't exist #ERROR NoMethod
    etc.

#Reasons to love acts_as_archival#
1. It's consistent
See [xx_test](http://github.com/janxious/indyrb_archival_demo/blob/master/test/unit/xx_test.rb)

2. It has a simple interface<br />
See [xx_test]http://github.com/janxious/indyrb_archival_demo/blob/master/test/unit/xx_test.rb()<br />
marking a class as AAA adds 4 class methods and 3 instance methods, and 2 callbacks

3. Atomic
you won't unarchive associations unintentionally

4. Our documentation isn't "Read the code"
Srsly, check out that [README](http://github.com/expectedbehavior/acts_as_archival/blob/master/README)

#Reasons to hate AAA#
1. The code is still pretty complicated
[acts_as_archival.rb](http://github.com/expectedbehavior/acts_as_archival/blob/master/lib/expected_behavior/acts_as_archival.rb)

  def act_on_all_archival_associations(head_archive_number, options={})
    return if options.length == 0
    options[:association_options] ||= Proc.new { true }
    self.class.reflect_on_all_associations.each do |association|
      if association.klass.is_archival? && association.macro.to_s =~ /^has/ && options[:association_options].call(association)
        act_on_a_related_archival(association.klass, association.primary_key_name, id, head_archive_number, options)
      end
    end
  end
      
  def act_on_a_related_archival(klass, key_name, id, head_archive_number, options={})
    # puts "[klass => #{klass.name}, key_name => #{key_name}, :id => #{id}, :head_archive_number => #{head_archive_number}, options => #{options.inspect}]"
    return if options.length == 0 || (!options[:archive] && !options[:unarchive])
    if options[:archive]
      klass.unarchived.find(:all, :conditions => ["#{key_name} = ?", id]).each do |related_record|
        related_record.archive(head_archive_number)
      end
    else
      klass.archived.find(:all, :conditions => ["#{key_name} = ? AND archive_number = ?", id, head_archive_number]).each do |related_record|
        related_record.unarchive(head_archive_number)
      end
    end
  end
